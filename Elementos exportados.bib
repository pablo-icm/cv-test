FAR showed a substantial loss of genetic variability (haplotypic diversity, h=0.49±0.066; nucleotide diversity, \$π\$=0.006±0.004; private allelic richness, pAg=0.28) to its donor population ATL (h=0.69±0.114; \$π\$=0.009±0.006; pAg=1.21). Pairwise F ST values of microsatellite data were highly significant (P ST and F ST values between ATL and MED were highly significant (P {\textless}0.0001) with mtDNA CR-I (0.228) and with microsatellite data (0.095), respectively. While loss of genetic variability in FAR could be associated with the sampling error when the broodstock was established, the results of parental and sibship inference suggest that most of these losses can be attributed to a high variance in reproductive success among members of the broodstock, particularly among females.},

Canonical variate analysis on weight matrix scores, including the uniform component (W′), at the end of the experiment revealed differences in body shape between experimental groups. The low density group presented a similar change pattern as that of the high density group but was less intense. Differences were discussed in terms of the effect of a high stocking density on the shape of soles which were very close to commercialization.

	abstract = {Upon phosphorus (P) deficiency, marine phytoplankton reduce their requirements for P by replacing membrane phospholipids with alternative non-phosphorus lipids. It was very recently demonstrated that a SAR11 isolate also shares this capability when phosphate starved in culture. Yet, the extent to which this process occurs in other marine heterotrophic bacteria and in the natural environment is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the substitution of membrane phospholipids for a variety of non-phosphorus lipids is a conserved response to P deficiency among phylogenetically diverse marine heterotrophic bacteria, including members of the Alphaproteobacteria and Flavobacteria. By deletion mutagenesis and complementation in the model marine bacterium Phaeobacter sp. MED193 and heterologous expression in recombinant Escherichia coli, we confirm the roles of a phospholipase C (PlcP) and a glycosyltransferase in lipid remodelling. Analyses of the Global Ocean Sampling and Tara Oceans metagenome data sets demonstrate that PlcP is particularly abundant in areas characterized by low phosphate concentrations. Furthermore, we show that lipid remodelling occurs seasonally and responds to changing nutrient conditions in natural microbial communities from the Mediterranean Sea. Together, our results point to the key role of lipid substitution as an adaptive strategy enabling heterotrophic bacteria to thrive in the vast P-depleted areas of the ocean.The ISME Journal advance online publication, 13 November 2015; doi:10.1038/ismej.2015.172.},

We reported a new set of records and reviewed all the historical observations of these species. The analysis of a mitochondrial DNA fragment of the newest records provided insights about the origin of the individuals. The Kemp's ridley turtles arrived from the western Atlantic nesting beaches, although the discovering of a new haplotype suggested the existence of an unknown or low sampled nesting area of origin. Furthermore, the genetic analysis was crucial for the species identification in one specimen, hence recommending the use of genetic markers to confirm the presence of a rare species. All green turtles presented haplotypes exclusive from Atlantic nesting beaches and concentrated in the African populations. Thus, the closest eastern Mediterranean nesting areas were discarded as source populations and a new migration route for this species was described.},

Genes encoding for photosystem (PS) I and II reaction centre proteins are found in cyanophages and are believed to increase their fitness. Two viral PSI gene arrangements are known, psaJF→C→A→B→K→E→D and psaD→C→A→B. The shared genes between these gene cassettes and their encoded proteins are distinguished by \%G + C and protein sequence respectively. The data on the psaD→C→A→B gene organization were reported from only two partial gene cassettes coming from Global Ocean Sampling stations in the Pacific and Indian oceans. Now we have extended our search to 370 marine stations from six metagenomic projects. Genes corresponding to both PSI gene arrangements were detected in the Pacific, Indian and Atlantic oceans, confined to a strip along the equator (30°N and 30°S). In addition, we found that the predicted structure of the viral PsaA protein from the psaD→C→A→B organization contains a lumenal loop conserved in PsaA proteins from Synechococcus, but is completely absent in viral PsaA proteins from the psaJF→C→A→B→K→E→D gene organization and most Prochlorococcus strains. This may indicate a co-evolutionary scenario where cyanophages containing either of these gene organizations infect cyanobacterial ecotypes biogeographically restricted to the 30°N and 30°S equatorial strip.},

Using Illumina amplicon sequencing of the puf M gene coupled with multivariate, time series and co-occurrence analyses we examined their temporal dynamics over a decade at the Blanes Bay Microbial Observatory (NW Mediterranean). Phylogroup K ( Gammaproteobacteria ) was the most abundant over all seasons, with phylogroups E and G ( Alphaproteobacteria ) being often abundant in spring. A clear seasonal trend was observed in diversity, with maximum values in winter. Multivariate analyses showed sample clustering by season, with a relevant proportion of the variance (38\%) explained by day length, temperature, salinity, phototrophic nanoflagellate abundance and phosphate concentration. Time series analysis showed that only 42\% of the Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) analyzed presented marked seasonality but these represented most of the abundance (92\%). Interestingly, distinct temporal dynamics were observed within the same phylogroup and even within different ASVs conforming the same Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU). Likewise, co-occurrence analysis highlighted negative associations between various ASVs within the same phylogroup. Altogether our results picture the AAP assemblage as highly seasonal, containing ecotypes with distinctive niche partitioning rather than being a cohesive functional group.},

	abstract = {Cyanobacteria are important contributors to primary production in the open oceans. Over the past decade, various photosynthesis-related genes have been found in viruses that infect cyanobacteria (cyanophages). Although photosystem II (PSII) genes are common in both cultured cyanophages and environmental samples 1–4 , viral photosystem I (vPSI) genes have so far only been detected in environmental samples 5,6 . Here, we have used a targeted strategy to isolate a cyanophage from the tropical Pacific Ocean that carries a PSI gene cassette with seven distinct PSI genes (psaJF, C, A, B, K, E, D) as well as two PSII genes (psbA, D). This cyanophage, P-TIM68, belongs to the T4-like myoviruses, has a prolate capsid, a long contractile tail and infects Prochlorococcus sp. strain MIT9515. Phage photosynthesis genes from both photosystems are expressed during infection, and the resultant proteins are incorporated into membranes of the infected host. Moreover, photosynthetic capacity in the cell is maintained throughout the infection cycle with enhancement of cyclic electron flow around PSI. Analysis of metagenomic data from the Tara Oceans expedition 7 shows that phages carrying PSI gene cassettes are abundant in the tropical Pacific Ocean, composing up to 28\% of T4-like cyanomyophages. They are also present in the tropical Indian and Atlantic Oceans. P-TIM68 populations, specifically, compose on average 22\% of the PSI-gene-cassette carrying phages. Our results suggest that cyanophages carrying PSI and PSII genes are likely to maintain and even manipulate photosynthesis during infection of their Prochlorococcus hosts in the tropical oceans.},

Marine Bacteroidetes constitute a very abundant bacterioplankton group in the oceans that plays a key role in recycling particulate organic matter and includes several photoheterotrophic members containing proteorhodopsin. Relatively few marine Bacteroidetes species have been described and, moreover, they correspond to cultured isolates, which in most cases do not represent the actual abundant or ecologically relevant microorganisms in the natural environment. In this study, we explored the microdiversity of 98 Single Amplified Genomes (SAGs) retrieved from the surface waters of the underexplored North Indian Ocean, whose most closely related isolate is Kordia algicida OT-1. Using Multi Locus Sequencing Analysis (MLSA) we found no microdiversity in the tested conserved phylogenetic markers (16S rRNA and 23S rRNA genes), the fast-evolving Internal Transcribed Spacer and the functional markers proteorhodopsin and the beta-subunit of RNA polymerase. Furthermore, we carried out a Fragment Recruitment Analysis (FRA) with marine metagenomes to learn about the distribution and dynamics of this microorganism in different locations, depths and size fractions. This analysis indicated that this taxon belongs to the rare biosphere, showing its highest abundance after upwelling-induced phytoplankton blooms and sinking to the deep ocean with large organic matter particles. This uncultured Kordia lineage likely represents a novel Kordia species (Kordia sp. CFSAG39SUR) that contains the proteorhodopsin gene and has a widespread spatial and vertical distribution. The combination of SAGs and MLSA makes a valuable approach to infer putative ecological roles of uncultured abundant microorganisms.},

Among them, metagenomics is a PCR free approach that contains all genetic information from microbial assemblages and is today performed at a relatively large scale and reasonable cost, mostly based on very short reads. Here, we investigated the potential of metagenomics to provide taxonomic reports of marine microbial eukaryotes. We prepared a curated database with reference sequences of the V4 region of 18S rDNA clustered at 97\% similarity and used this database to extract and classify metagenomic reads. More than half of them were unambiguously affiliated to a unique reference whilst the rest could be assigned to a given taxonomic group. The overall diversity reported by metagenomics was similar to that obtained by amplicon sequencing of the V4 and V9 regions of the 18S rRNA gene, although either one or both of these amplicon surveys performed poorly for groups like Excavata, Amoebozoa, Fungi and Haptophyta. We then studied the diversity of picoeukaryotes and nanoeukaryotes using 91 metagenomes from surface down to bathypelagic layers in different oceans, unveiling a clear taxonomic separation between size fractions and depth layers. Finally, we retrieved long rDNA sequences from assembled metagenomes that improved phylogenetic reconstructions of particular groups. Overall, this study shows metagenomics as an excellent resource for taxonomic exploration of marine microbial eukaryotes.},

Despite recent advances in understanding their taxonomic and genomic compositions, little is known about how their transcriptomes vary globally. Here, we present a dataset of 187 metatranscriptomes and 370 metagenomes from 126 globally distributed sampling stations and establish a resource of 47 million genes to study community-level transcriptomes across depth layers from pole-to-pole. We examine gene expression changes and community turnover as the underlying mechanisms shaping community transcriptomes along these axes of environmental variation and show how their individual contributions differ for multiple biogeochemically relevant processes. Furthermore, we find the relative contribution of gene expression changes to be significantly lower in polar than in non-polar waters and hypothesize that in polar regions, alterations in community activity in response to ocean warming will be driven more strongly by changes in organismal composition than by gene regulatory mechanisms.

	abstract = {High-throughput sequencing (HTS) of the 16S rRNA gene has been used successfully to describe the structure and dynamics of microbial communities. Picocyanobacteria are important members of bacterioplankton communities, and, so far, they have predominantly been targeted using universal bacterial primers, providing a limited resolution of the picocyanobacterial community structure and dynamics. To increase such resolution, the study of a particular target group is best approached with the use of specific primers. Here, we aimed to design and evaluate specific primers for aquatic picocyanobacterial genera to be used with high-throughput sequencing. Since the various regions of the 16S rRNA gene have different degrees of conservation in different bacterial groups, we therefore first determined which hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene provides the highest taxonomic and phylogenetic resolution for the genera Synechococcus, Prochlorococcus, and Cyanobium. An in silico analysis showed that the V5, V6, and V7 hypervariable regions appear to be the most informative for this group. We then designed primers flanking these hypervariable regions and tested them in natural marine and freshwater communities. We successfully detected that most (97\%) of the obtained reads could be assigned to picocyanobacterial genera. We defined operational taxonomic units as exact sequence variants (zero-radius operational taxonomic units [zOTUs]), which allowed us to detect higher genetic diversity and infer ecologically relevant information about picocyanobacterial community composition and dynamics in different aquatic systems. Our results open the door to future studies investigating picocyanobacterial diversity in aquatic systems.},

However, the official procedures for classification and characterization of a novel prokaryotic species still rely on isolates. Nevertheless, due to single cell genomics, it is possible to retrieve genomes from environmental samples by sequencing them individually, and to assign specific genes to a specific taxon, regardless of their ability to grow in culture. In this study, a complete description was performed for uncultured Kordia sp. TARA\_039\_SRF, a proposed novel species within the genus Kordia, using culture-independent techniques. The type material was a high-quality draft genome (94.97\% complete, 4.65\% gene redundancy) co-assembled using ten nearly identical single amplified genomes (SAGs) from surface seawater in the North Indian Ocean during the Tara Oceans Expedition. The assembly process was optimized to obtain the best possible assembly metrics and a less fragmented genome. The closest relative of the species was Kordia periserrulae, which shared 97.56\% similarity of the 16S rRNA gene, 75\% orthologs and 89.13\% average nucleotide identity. The functional potential of the proposed novel species included proteorhodopsin, the ability to incorporate nitrate, cytochrome oxidases with high affinity for oxygen, and CAZymes that were unique features within the genus. Its abundance at different depths and size fractions was also evaluated together with its functional annotation, revealing that its putative ecological niche could be particles of phytoplanktonic origin. It could putatively attach to these particles and consume them while sinking to the deeper and oxygen depleted layers of the North Indian Ocean.},

Predicting the future of this ecosystem requires understanding of the responses of Arctic microorganisms to environmental change, as they are the main drivers of global biogeochemical cycles. However, little is known about the ecology and metabolic potential of active Arctic microbes. Here, we reconstructed a total of 3,550 metagenomic bins from 41 seawater metagenomes collected as part of the Tara Oceans expedition, covering five different Arctic Ocean regions as well as the sub-Arctic North Atlantic Ocean and including various depths and different seasons (spring to autumn). Of these bins, 530 could be classified as Metagenome Assembled Genomes (MAGs) and over 75\% of them represented novel species. We describe their habitat range and environmental preferences, as well as their metabolic capabilities, building the most comprehensive dataset of uncultured bacterial and archaeal genomes from the Arctic Ocean to date. We found a prevalence of mixotrophs, while chemolithoautotrophs were mostly present in the mesopelagic Arctic Ocean during spring and autumn. Finally, the catalogue of Arctic MAGs was complemented with metagenomes and metatranscriptomes from the global ocean to identify the most active MAGs present exclusively in polar metagenomes. These polar MAGs, which display a range of metabolic strategies, might represent Arctic sentinels of climate change and should be considered in prospective studies of the future state of the Arctic Ocean.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here we investigate a deep-sea fungal Metagenome-Assembled Genome (MAG) with a widespread distribution and a relatively high abundance in specific locations. A total of 83 globally distributed metagenomes recovered from 1,500m to 4,000m depth, which were part of the Malaspina 2010 expedition, were co-assembled and binned using different algorithms. We retrieved 15.61Mb of a putative yeast, phylogenetically related to Tilletiopsis spp., featuring ca. 80\% of genome recovery. Gene prediction based on conserved orthologs indicated 4,370 genes, which were annotated using a number of databases. In particular, a total of 2,846 genes were annotated using KEGG, with most matching orthologs originating from other fungi (Pseudozyma flocculosa [47.4\%], Ustilago maydis [37.5\%] and Malassezia globosa [3\%]). Functions related to membrane transporters, endocytosis and potential pathogenicity as well as lysosome-like proteins are currently being analysed to understand the ecology of this uncharacterized fungi. Analyses of 18S rDNA and rRNA amplicons from 13 globally-distributed vertical profiles pointed to geographically heterogeneous abundances that tended to increase with depth. In particular, MAG rRNA detection in the deep ocean points to an active metabolism. Analyses of SNPs and indels indicate fine¿grained genomic change that could reveal ecotypic variation.

	url = {https://sfecologie2016.sciencesconf.org/105972},
	abstract = {Understanding how historical and contemporary processes shape and maintain genetic diversity patterns is a central challenge for ecologists with direct implications in biodiversity conservation. Here, we studied the population genetic structure of Paramuricea clavata a habitat forming octocoral from the coralligenous, the most diverse but also most threatened biogenic reef in the Mediterranean. Focusing on 13 populations along a latitudinal gradient in the eastern Adriatic and using microsatellite markers, we revealed a pattern of spatial genetic structure combining hierarchical genetic clusters and isolation by distance (IBD). Interestingly, this pattern came along with a significant northward decrease in genetic diversity. While oceanographic barriers to gene flow and restricted dispersal abilities may maintain the IBD and the genetic clusters, the latitudinal genetic gradient raises the question of the legacy of historical processes on the contemporary genetic structure. Implementing extensive evolutionary and demographic history analyses based on approximate Bayesian computations and maximum likelihood methods, we demonstrated that a northward “serial founder events range expansion” following the last glacial maximum may explain this latitudinal genetic gradient. Besides, some alleles reach high frequencies at the edge of expansion suggesting the occurrence of allele surfing during this expansion range. Integrating these patterns and processes, we bridge the gap between the evolutionary and the conservation biology of P. clavata in the eastern Adriatic and we promote an eco-evolutionary based management plan, which will benefit the associated coralligenous biodiversity},

	abstract = {Microbes are important drivers of biogeochemical processes determining the fate of mercury (Hg) in the aquatic systems. In particular, they have a relevant role on formation and degradation of methylmercury (MeHg) but also on the reduction of inorganic divalent Hg (HgII) to elemental Hg0. The recent discovery of the gene cluster involved in MeHg formation (hgcA/hgcB) has improved the knowledge on identity and metabolic features of the microbial community performing this process. Yet, little is known about the diversity and expression of the organisms involved in MeHg demethylation and HgII reduction, which are carried out by the merB and merA genes, respectively. Here, we explore the temperate global deep ocean metagenomes and metatranscriptomes of the Malapasina 2010 circumnavigation from two different plankton size fractions (0.2-0.8 μm and 0.8-20 μm), commonly referred to the life-style of free-living and particle–attached microorganisms, respectively. By using multiple-specific hidden markov models (HMM), here we show the biogeography and expression patterns of merA and merB genes. Analysing the metagenomes, we observed that the abundance patterns of merA and merB responded to the life-style of the organisms, with higher abundance in the particle-attached size fraction, as well as to the oceanographic basin. Interestingly, the metatranscriptomes revealed that expression patterns of merA and merB genes differed with their corresponding abundances. For example, merA and merB expression patterns in the Canary Islands basin were significantly lower in particle-attached compared to the free-living fraction. Alteromonas and Pseudoalteromonas (Gammaproteobacteria) were important contributors to both the abundance and expression of merA and merB at a global scale. This study represents the first global deep ocean analysis of the merAB genes and transcripts and reveals the main players involved in the divalent-Hg reduction and MeHg degradation in the marine Hg biogeochemical cycle},

Yet, the functional exploration of its microbial communities lags far behind other environments. Here we analyze 58 metagenomes from tropical and subtropical deep oceans to generate the Malaspina Gene Database. Free-living or particle-attached lifestyles drive functional differences in bathypelagic prokaryotic communities, regardless of their biogeography. Ammonia and CO oxidation pathways are enriched in the free-living microbial communities and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium and H2 oxidation pathways in the particle-attached, while the Calvin Benson-Bassham cycle is the most prevalent inorganic carbon fixation pathway in both size fractions. Reconstruction of the Malaspina Deep Metagenome-Assembled Genomes reveals unique non-cyanobacterial diazotrophic bacteria and chemolithoautotrophic prokaryotes. The widespread potential to grow both autotrophically and heterotrophically suggests that mixotrophy is an ecologically relevant trait in the deep ocean.

We applied genome-resolved metagenomics to 41 Arctic seawater samples, collected at various depths in different seasons during the Tara Oceans Polar Circle expedition, to evaluate the ecology, metabolic potential and activity of resident bacteria and archaea. We assembled 530 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) to form the Arctic MAGs catalogue comprising 526 species. A total of 441 MAGs belonged to species that have not previously been reported and 299 genomes showed an exclusively polar distribution. Most Arctic MAGs have large genomes and the potential for fast generation times, both of which may enable adaptation to a copiotrophic lifestyle in nutrient-rich waters. We identified 38 habitat generalists and 111 specialists in the Arctic Ocean. We also found a general prevalence of 14 mixotrophs, while chemolithoautotrophs were mostly present in the mesopelagic layer during spring and autumn. We revealed 62 MAGs classified as key Arctic species, found only in the Arctic Ocean, showing the highest gene expression values and predicted to have habitat-specific traits. The Artic MAGs catalogue will inform our understanding of polar microorganisms that drive global biogeochemical cycles. Using genome-resolved metagenomics for 41 Arctic seawater samples, this ecogenomic analysis of 530 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from the polar Arctic Ocean reveals uncultured Arctic bacterial and archaeal MAGs, their gene expression patterns, habitat preferences and metabolic potential.},

	abstract = {The bathypelagic ocean (1000-4000 m depth) is the largest aquatic biome on Earth but it is still largely unexplored. Due to its prevalent low dissolved organic carbon concentrations, most of the prokaryotic metabolic activity is assumed to be associated to particles. The role of free-living prokaryotes has thus been mostly ignored, except that of some chemolithoautotrophic lineages. Here we used a global bathypelagic survey of size-fractionated metagenomic and 16S (genes and transcripts) data and performed a differential abundance analysis to explore the functional traits of the different prokaryotic life-strategies, their contribution to the active microbiome, and the role that the quality of the dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays in driving this contribution. We found that free-living prokaryotes have limited capacity to uplift their metabolism in response to environmental changes and display comparatively lower growth rates than particle associated prokaryotes, but are responsible for the synthesis of vitamins in the bathypelagic. Furthermore, their contribution to the active prokaryotic microbiome increased towards waters depleted of labile DOM, which represented a large fraction of the tropical and subtropical ocean sampled stations. This points to a relevant yet overlooked role of free-living prokaryotes in DOM cycling in the vast bathypelagic desert.},

            Mercury methylation genes (
            hgcAB)
            mediate the formation of the toxic methylmercury and have been identified from diverse environments, including freshwater and marine ecosystems, Arctic permafrost, forest and paddy soils, coal-ash amended sediments, chlor-alkali plants discharges and geothermal springs. Here we present the first attempt at a standardized protocol for the detection, identification and quantification of
            hgc
            genes from metagenomes. Our Hg-MATE (Hg-cycling Microorganisms in Aquatic and Terrestrial Ecosystems) database, a catalogue of
            hgc
            genes, provides the most accurate information to date on the taxonomic identity and functional/metabolic attributes of microorganisms responsible for Hg methylation in the environment. Furthermore, we introduce “marky-coco”, a ready-to-use bioinformatic pipeline based on
            de novo
            single-metagenome assembly, for easy and accurate characterization of
            hgc
            genes from environmental samples. We compared the recovery of
            hgc
            genes from environmental metagenomes using the marky-coco pipeline with an approach based on co-assembly of multiple metagenomes. Our data show similar efficiency in both approaches for most environments except those with high diversity (i.e., paddy soils) for which a co-assembly approach was preferred. Finally, we discuss the definition of true
            hgc
            genes and methods to normalize
            hgc
            gene counts from metagenomes.},

Here, combining culture-dependent analyses with metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data, we show that marine bacteria that encode mer genes are widespread and active in the global ocean. We explored the distribution of these genes in 290 marine heterotrophic bacteria (Alteromonas and Marinobacter spp.) isolated from different oceanographic regions and depths, and assessed their tolerance to diverse concentrations of Hg2+ and MeHg. In particular, the Alteromonas sp. ISS312 strain presented the highest tolerance capacity and a degradation efficiency for MeHg of 98.2\% in 24 h. Fragment recruitment analyses of Alteromonas sp. genomes (ISS312 strain and its associated reconstructed metagenome assembled genome MAG-0289) against microbial bathypelagic metagenomes confirm their prevalence in the deep ocean. Moreover, we retrieved 54 merA and 6 merB genes variants related to the Alteromonas sp. ISS312 strain from global metagenomes and metatranscriptomes from Tara Oceans. Our findings highlight the biological reductive MeHg degradation as a relevant pathway of the ocean Hg biogeochemical cycle.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: COVID-19 presents a spectrum of signs and symptoms in pregnant women that might resemble preeclampsia. Differentiation between severe COVID-19 and preeclampsia is difficult in some cases.
OBJECTIVE: To study biomarkers of endothelial damage, coagulation, innate immune response, and angiogenesis in preeclampsia and COVID-19 in pregnancy in addition to in vitro alterations in endothelial cells exposed to sera from pregnant women with preeclampsia and COVID-19.
STUDY DESIGN: Plasma and sera samples were obtained from pregnant women with COVID-19 infection classified into mild (n=10) or severe (n=9) and from women with normotensive pregnancies as controls (n=10) and patients with preeclampsia (n=13). A panel of plasmatic biomarkers was assessed, including vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, soluble tumor necrosis factor-receptor I, heparan sulfate, von Willebrand factor antigen (activity and multimeric pattern), α2-antiplasmin, C5b9, neutrophil extracellular traps, placental growth factor, soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1, and angiopoietin 2. In addition, microvascular endothelial cells were exposed to patients' sera, and changes in the cell expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 on cell membranes and von Willebrand factor release to the extracellular matrix were evaluated through immunofluorescence. Changes in inflammation cell signaling pathways were also assessed by of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation. Statistical analysis included univariate and multivariate methods.
RESULTS: Biomarker profiles of patients with mild COVID-19 were similar to those of controls. Both preeclampsia and severe COVID-19 showed significant alterations in most circulating biomarkers with distinctive profiles. Whereas severe COVID-19 exhibited higher concentrations of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, soluble tumor necrosis factor-α receptor I, heparan sulfate, von Willebrand factor antigen, and neutrophil extracellular traps, with a significant reduction of placental growth factor compared with controls, preeclampsia presented a marked increase in vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and soluble tumor necrosis factor-α receptor I (significantly increased compared with controls and patients with severe COVID-19), with a striking reduction in von Willebrand factor antigen, von Willebrand factor activity, and α2-antiplasmin. As expected, reduced placental growth factor, increased soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 and angiopoietin 2, and a very high soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 to placental growth factor ratio were also observed in preeclampsia. In addition, a significant increase in C5b9 and neutrophil extracellular traps was also detected in preeclampsia compared with controls. Principal component analysis demonstrated a clear separation between patients with preeclampsia and the other groups (first and second components explained 42.2\% and 13.5\% of the variance), mainly differentiated by variables related to von Willebrand factor, soluble tumor necrosis factor-receptor I, heparan sulfate, and soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1. Von Willebrand factor multimeric analysis revealed the absence of von Willebrand factor high-molecular-weight multimers in preeclampsia (similar profile to von Willebrand disease type 2A), whereas in healthy pregnancies and COVID-19 patients, von Willebrand factor multimeric pattern was normal. Sera from both preeclampsia and severe COVID-19 patients induced an overexpression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and von Willebrand factor in endothelial cells in culture compared with controls. However, the effect of preeclampsia was less pronounced than the that of severe COVID-19. Immunoblots of lysates from endothelial cells exposed to mild and severe COVID-19 and preeclampsia sera showed an increase in p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation. Patients with severe COVID-19 and preeclampsia were statistically different from controls, suggesting that both severe COVID-19 and preeclampsia sera can activate inflammatory signaling pathways.
CONCLUSION: Although similar in in vitro endothelial dysfunction, preeclampsia and severe COVID-19 exhibit distinctive profiles of circulating biomarkers related to endothelial damage, coagulopathy, and angiogenic imbalance that could aid in the differential diagnosis of these entities.},

Here, we present a conceptual framework, its translation into the computational workflow AGNOSTOS and a demonstration on how we can bridge the known-unknown gap in genomes and metagenomes. By analyzing 415,971,742 genes predicted from 1749 metagenomes and 28,941 bacterial and archaeal genomes, we quantify the extent of the unknown fraction, its diversity, and its relevance across multiple organisms and environments. The unknown sequence space is exceptionally diverse, phylogenetically more conserved than the known fraction and predominantly taxonomically restricted at the species level. From the 71 M genes identified to be of unknown function, we compiled a collection of 283,874 lineage-specific genes of unknown function for Cand. Patescibacteria (also known as Candidate Phyla Radiation, CPR), which provides a significant resource to expand our understanding of their unusual biology. Finally, by identifying a target gene of unknown function for antibiotic resistance, we demonstrate how we can enable the generation of hypotheses that can be used to augment experimental data.},

	abstract = {Mercury (Hg) methylation genes (hgcAB) mediate the formation of the toxic methylmercury and have been identified from diverse environments, including freshwater and marine ecosystems, Arctic permafrost, forest and paddy soils, coal-ash amended sediments, chlor-alkali plants discharges and geothermal springs. Here we present the first attempt at a standardized protocol for the detection, identification and quantification of hgc genes from metagenomes. Our Hg-cycling microorganisms in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems (Hg-MATE) database, a catalogue of hgc genes, provides the most accurate information to date on the taxonomic identity and functional/metabolic attributes of microorganisms responsible for Hg methylation in the environment. Furthermore, we introduce “marky-coco”, a ready-to-use bioinformatic pipeline based on de novo single-metagenome assembly, for easy and accurate characterization of hgc genes from environmental samples. We compared the recovery of hgc genes from environmental metagenomes using the marky-coco pipeline with an approach based on coassembly of multiple metagenomes. Our data show similar efficiency in both approaches for most environments except those with high diversity (i.e., paddy soils) for which a coassembly approach was preferred. Finally, we discuss the definition of true hgc genes and methods to normalize hgc gene counts from metagenomes.},

            Microbial assemblages under sea ice of Dease Strait, Canadian Arctic, were sequenced for metagenomes and metatranscriptomes of the small size fraction (0.2 to 3 µm). The community from early March was typical for this season, with
            Alpha
            - and
            Gammaproteobacteria
            as the dominant taxa, followed by
            Thaumarchaeota
            and
            Bacteroidetes
            . Towards summer,
            Bacteroidetes
            and particularly the genus
            Polaribacter
            , became increasingly dominant, followed by the
            Gammaproteobacteria
            . Analysis of genes responsible for microbial acquisition of iron showed an abundance of ABC transporters for divalent cations and ferrous iron. The most abundant transporters, however, were the outer membrane TonB dependent transporters of iron-siderophore complexes. The abundance of iron acquisition genes suggested this element was essential for the microbial assemblage. Interestingly,
            Gammaproteobacteria
            were responsible for most of the siderophore synthesis genes. On the contrary,
            Bacteroidetes
            did not synthesize siderophores but accounted for most of the transporters, suggesting a role as cheaters in the competition for siderophores as public goods. Likely, this cheating ability of the

            contributed to their dominance in summer.},

In the case of aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic (AAP) bacteria, the pufM gene has been established as the genetic marker for this particular functional group, although available primers are known to have amplification biases. We review here the existing primers for pufM gene amplification, design new ones, and evaluate their phylogenetic coverage. We then use samples from contrasting marine environments to evaluate their performance. By comparing the taxonomic composition of communities retrieved with metagenomics and with different amplicon approaches, we show that the commonly used PCR primers are biased towards the Gammaproteobacteria phylum and some Alphaproteobacteria clades. The metagenomic approach, as well as the use of other combinations of the existing and newly designed primers, show that these groups are in fact less abundant than previously observed, and that a great proportion of pufM sequences are affiliated to uncultured representatives, particularly in the open ocean. Altogether, the framework developed here becomes a better alternative for future studies based on the pufM gene and, additionally, serves as a reference for primer evaluation of other functional genes.},

Novel analyses enabled by OGA2 include phylogenetic tree inference to visualize user queries within their context of sequence homologues from both the marine environmental dataset and the RefSeq database. An Application Programming Interface (API) now allows users to query OGA2 using command-line tools, hence providing local workflow integration. Finally, gene abundance can be interactively filtered directly on map displays using any of the available environmental variables.

However, very little is currently known about how the size of prokaryotic genomes evolves in the global ocean and whether patterns reflect shifts in resource availability in the epipelagic and relatively stable deep-sea environmental conditions. Using 364 marine microbial metagenomes, we investigate how the average genome size of uncultured planktonic prokaryotes varies across the tropical and polar oceans to the hadal realm. We find that genome size is highest in the perennially cold polar ocean, reflecting elongation of coding genes and gene dosage effects due to duplications in the interior ocean microbiome. Moreover, the rate of change in genome size due to temperature is 16-fold higher than with depth up to 200 m. Our results demonstrate how environmental factors can influence marine microbial genome size selection and ecological strategies of the microbiome.},

	abstract = {Research on marine microbial communities is growing, but studies are hard to compare because of variation in seawater sampling protocols. To help researchers in the inter-comparison of studies that use different seawater sampling methodologies, as well as to help them design future sampling campaigns, we developed the EuroMarine Open Science Exploration initiative (EMOSE). Within the EMOSE framework, we sampled thousands of liters of seawater from a single station in the NW Mediterranean Sea (Service d'Observation du Laboratoire Arago [SOLA], Banyuls-sur-Mer), during one single day. The resulting dataset includes multiple seawater processing approaches, encompassing different material-type kinds of filters (cartridge membrane and flat membrane), three different size fractionations ({\textgreater}0.22 µm, 0.22–3 µm, 3–20 µm and {\textgreater}20 µm), and a number of different seawater volumes ranging from 1 L up to 1000 L. We show that the volume of seawater that is filtered does not have a significant effect on prokaryotic and protist diversity, independently of the sequencing strategy. However, there was a clear difference in alpha and beta diversity between size fractions and between these and “whole water” (with no pre-fractionation). Overall, we recommend care when merging data from datasets that use filters of different pore size, but we consider that the type of filter and volume should not act as confounding variables for the tested sequencing strategies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a publicly available dataset effectively allows for the clarification of the impact of marine microbiome methodological options across a wide range of protocols, including large-scale variations in sampled volume.},

Here, we explored the distribution of these genes in 290 marine heterotrophic bacteria (Alteromonas and Marinobacter spp.) isolated from different oceanographic regions and depths, and assessed their tolerance to diverse concentrations of Hg2+ and MeHg. About 25\% of the isolates presented merA and only 8.9\% presented both merAB genes, including the strain ISS312 that exhibited the highest tolerance capacity and a degradation efficiency of 98.2\% in 24 h. Fragment recruitment analyses of ISS312 genome against microbial metagenomes indicated an extensive distribution across the global bathypelagic ocean. Our findings highlighted that mercury resistance genes are widely distributed in a non-highly polluted environment such as the pelagic marine environment, and that degradation of the neurotoxic MeHg can be performed through the ocean water column by some heterotrophic bacteria at high efficiency with important implications in the biogeochemical cycle of mercury and potentially for the environment and human health.

	abstract = {Traditional culture techniques usually retrieve a small fraction of the marine microbial diversity, which mainly belong to the so-called rare biosphere. However, this paradigm has not been fully tested at a broad scale, especially in the deep ocean. Here, we examined the fraction of heterotrophic bacterial communities in photic and deep ocean layers that could be recovered by culture-dependent techniques at a large scale. We compared 16S rRNA gene sequences from a collection of 2003 cultured heterotrophic marine bacteria with global 16S rRNA metabarcoding datasets (16S TAGs) covering surface, mesopelagic and bathypelagic ocean samples that included 16 of the 23 samples used for isolation. These global datasets represent 60 322 unique 16S amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). Our results reveal a significantly higher proportion of isolates identical to ASVs in deeper ocean layers reaching up to 28\% of the 16S TAGs of the bathypelagic microbial communities, which included the isolation of 3 of the top 10 most abundant 16S ASVs in the global bathypelagic ocean, related to the genera Sulfitobacter, Halomonas and Erythrobacter. These isolates contributed differently to the prokaryotic communities across different plankton size fractions, recruiting between 38\% in the free-living fraction (0.2–0.8 µm) and up to 45\% in the largest particles (20–200 µm) in the bathypelagic ocean. Our findings support the hypothesis that sinking particles in the bathypelagic act as resource-rich habitats, suitable for the growth of heterotrophic bacteria with a copiotroph lifestyle that can be cultured, and that these cultivable bacteria can also thrive as free-living bacteria.},

	abstract = {Marine sediments impacted by urban and industrial pollutants are typically exposed to reducing conditions and represent major reservoirs of toxic mercury species. Mercury methylation mediated by anaerobic microorganisms is favored under such conditions, yet little is known about potential microbial mechanisms for mercury detoxification. We used culture-independent (metagenomics, metabarcoding) and culture-dependent approaches in anoxic marine sediments to identify microbial indicators of mercury pollution and analyze the distribution of genes involved in mercury reduction (merA) and demethylation (merB). While none of the isolates featured merB genes, 52 isolates, predominantly affiliated with Gammaproteobacteria, were merA positive. In contrast, merA genes detected in metagenomes were assigned to different phyla, including Desulfobacterota, Actinomycetota, Gemmatimonadota, Nitrospirota, and Pseudomonadota. This indicates a widespread capacity for mercury reduction in anoxic sediment microbiomes. Notably, merA genes were predominately identified in Desulfobacterota, a phylum previously associated only with mercury methylation. Marker genes involved in the latter process (hgcAB) were also mainly assigned to Desulfobacterota, implying a potential central and multifaceted role of this phylum in the mercury cycle. Network analysis revealed that Desulfobacterota were associated with anaerobic fermenters, methanogens and sulfur-oxidizers, indicating potential interactions between key players of the carbon, sulfur and mercury cycling in anoxic marine sediments.},

Blood samples from participants were spiked ex vivo with apixaban 0 (APIX0), 40 (APIX40), and 160\&nbsp;ng/mL (APIX160). We assessed the effects of APIX on (1) clot formation, by ROTEM thromboelastometry; (2) thrombin generation primed by platelets; and (3) platelet and fibrin interactions with a thrombogenic surface, in a microfluidic model with circulating blood. APIX caused dose-related prolongations of clotting time with minimal impact on other ROTEM parameters. Thrombin generation was significantly inhibited by APIX160, with ASA + TICA actions showing the strongest inhibition (p \&lt; 0.01 vs APIX0). Microfluidic studies showed that APIX160 was more potent at suppressing platelet and fibrin interactions (p \&lt; 0.001 vs. APIX0). APIX40 demonstrated a consistent antithrombotic action but with a favorable protective effect on the structural quality of fibrin. APIX potentiated the antithrombotic effects of current antiplatelet regimens. APIX at 40\&nbsp;ng/mL, enhanced the antithrombotic action of single or dual antiplatelet regimens but was more conservative for hemostasis than the 160\&nbsp;ng/mL concentration.},

The biosynthetic potential of microorganisms in the open ocean remains largely uncharted owing to limitations in the analysis of genome-resolved data at the global scale. Here we investigated the diversity and novelty of biosynthetic gene clusters in the ocean by integrating around 10,000 microbial genomes from cultivated and single cells with more than 25,000 newly reconstructed draft genomes from more than 1,000 seawater samples. These efforts revealed approximately 40,000 putative mostly new biosynthetic gene clusters, several of which were found in previously unsuspected phylogenetic groups. Among these groups, we identified a lineage rich in biosynthetic gene clusters (‘
              Candidatus
              Eudoremicrobiaceae’) that belongs to an uncultivated bacterial phylum and includes some of the most biosynthetically diverse microorganisms in this environment. From these, we characterized the phospeptin and pythonamide pathways, revealing cases of unusual bioactive compound structure and enzymology, respectively. Together, this research demonstrates how microbiomics-driven strategies can enable the investigation of previously undescribed enzymes and natural products in underexplored microbial groups and environments.},

During the last decade, global cruises such as Tara Oceans and the Malaspina Expedition have expanded our understanding of the diversity and genetic repertoire of marine microbes. Nevertheless, there are still knowledge gaps regarding their diversity patterns throughout depth gradients ranging from the surface to the deep ocean. Here we present a dataset of 76 microbial metagenomes (MProfile) of the picoplankton size fraction (0.2–3.0 µm) collected in 11 vertical profiles covering contrasting ocean regions sampled during the Malaspina Expedition circumnavigation (7 depths, from surface to 4,000 m deep). The MProfile dataset produced 1.66 Tbp of raw DNA sequences from which we derived: 17.4 million genes clustered at 95\% sequence similarity (M-GeneDB-VP), 2,672 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of Archaea and Bacteria (Malaspina-VP-MAGs), and over 100,000 viral genomic sequences. This dataset will be a valuable resource for exploring the functional and taxonomic connectivity between the photic and bathypelagic tropical and sub-tropical ocean, while increasing our general knowledge of the Ocean microbiome.},

	abstract = {Marine sediments polluted from anthropogenic activities can be major reservoirs of toxic mercury species. Some microorganisms in these environments have the capacity to detoxify these pollutants, by using the mer operon. In this study, we characterized microbial cultures isolated from polluted marine sediments growing under diverse environmental conditions of salinity, oxygen availability and mercury tolerance. Specific growth rates and percentage of mercury removal were measured in batch cultures for a selection of isolates. A culture affiliated with Pseudomonas putida (MERCC\_1942), which contained a mer operon as well as other genes related to metal resistances, was selected as the best candidate for mercury elimination. In order to optimize mercury detoxification conditions for strain MERCC\_1942 in continuous culture, three different dilution rates were tested in bioreactors until the cultures achieved steady state, and they were subsequently exposed to a mercury spike; after 24 h, strain MERCC\_1942 removed up to 76\% of the total mercury. Moreover, when adapted to high growth rates in bioreactors, this strain exhibited the highest specific mercury detoxification rates. Finally, an immobilization protocol using the sol-gel technology was optimized. These results highlight that some sediment bacteria show capacity to detoxify mercury and could be used for bioremediation applications.},

	abstract = {Due to the scarcity of organic matter (OM) sources in the bathypelagic (1000–4000 m depth), prokaryotic metabolism is believed to be concentrated on particles originating from the surface. However, the structure of active bathypelagic prokaryotic communities and how it changes across environmental gradients remains unexplored. Using a combination of 16S rRNA gene and transcripts sequencing, metagenomics, and substrate uptake potential measurements, here we aimed to explore how water masses aging and the quality of OM influence the structure of the active microbiome, and the potential implications for community function. We found that the relative contribution of taxa with a free-living lifestyle to the active microbiome increased in older water masses that were enriched in recalcitrant OM, suggesting that these prokaryotes may also play a substantial role in the bathypelagic metabolism of vast areas of the ocean. In comparison to particle-associated prokaryotes, free-living prokaryotes exhibited lower potential metabolic rates, and harbored a limited number of two-component sensory systems, suggesting they have less ability to sense and respond to environmental cues. In contrast, particle-associated prokaryotes carried genes for particle colonization and carbohydrate utilization that were absent in prokaryotes with a free-living lifestyle. Consistently, we observed that prokaryotic communities inhabiting older waters displayed reduced abilities to colonize particles, and higher capabilities to use complex carbon sources, compared to communities in waters with a higher proportion of labile OM. Our results provide evidence of regionalization of the bathypelagic active prokaryotic microbiome, unveiling a niche partitioning based on the quality of OM.},

The community from early March was typical for this season, with Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria as the dominant taxa, followed by Thaumarchaeota and Bacteroidetes. Toward summer, Bacteroidetes, and particularly the genus Polaribacter, became increasingly dominant, followed by the Gammaproteobacteria. Analysis of genes responsible for microbial acquisition of iron showed an abundance of ABC transporters for divalent cations and ferrous iron. The most abundant transporters, however, were the outer membrane TonB-dependent transporters of iron-siderophore complexes. The abundance of iron acquisition genes suggested this element was essential for the microbial assemblage. Interestingly, Gammaproteobacteria were responsible for most of the siderophore synthesis genes. On the contrary, Bacteroidetes did not synthesize siderophores but accounted for most of the transporters, suggesting a role as cheaters in the competition for siderophores as public goods. This cheating ability of the Bacteroidetes may have contributed to their dominance in the summer.},
