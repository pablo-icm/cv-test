abstract: The bathypelagic ocean is one of the largest ecosystems on Earth, and contains
  half of the ocean’s microbial biomass. Bathypelagic microbial activity strongly
  relies on surface-derived particles, but there is growing evidence that the carbon
  released through solubilisation of these particles may not be suFFIcient to meet
  the energy demands of deep ocean prokaryotes. In this talk I will present a summary
  of our latest research on how deep ocean prokaryotes cope with carbon deprivation,
  respond to sudden pulses of carbon and survive in this energy limited environment,
  using a multifaceted approach that combines bulk rate measurements with single-cell
  techniques, 16S-rDNA sequencing and metagenomics
