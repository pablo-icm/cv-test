 abstract = {The bathypelagic ocean is one of the largest ecosystems on Earth, and contains half of the ocean’s microbial biomass. Bathypelagic microbial activity strongly relies on surface-derived particles, but there is growing evidence that the carbon released through solubilisation of these particles may not be suFFIcient to meet the energy demands of deep ocean prokaryotes. In this talk I will present a summary of our latest research on how deep ocean prokaryotes cope with carbon deprivation, respond to sudden pulses of carbon and survive in this energy limited environment, using a multifaceted approach that combines bulk rate measurements with single-cell techniques, 16S-rDNA sequencing and metagenomics},
