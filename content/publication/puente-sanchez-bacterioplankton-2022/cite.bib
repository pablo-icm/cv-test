Microbial assemblages under sea ice of Dease Strait, Canadian Arctic, were sequenced for metagenomes and metatranscriptomes of the small size fraction (0.2 to 3 µm). The community from early March was typical for this season, with
Alpha
- and
Gammaproteobacteria
as the dominant taxa, followed by
Thaumarchaeota
and
Bacteroidetes
. Towards summer,
Bacteroidetes
and particularly the genus
Polaribacter
, became increasingly dominant, followed by the
Gammaproteobacteria
. Analysis of genes responsible for microbial acquisition of iron showed an abundance of ABC transporters for divalent cations and ferrous iron. The most abundant transporters, however, were the outer membrane TonB dependent transporters of iron-siderophore complexes. The abundance of iron acquisition genes suggested this element was essential for the microbial assemblage. Interestingly,
Gammaproteobacteria
were responsible for most of the siderophore synthesis genes. On the contrary,
Bacteroidetes
did not synthesize siderophores but accounted for most of the transporters, suggesting a role as cheaters in the competition for siderophores as public goods. Likely, this cheating ability of the
Bacteroidetes
contributed to their dominance in summer.},
