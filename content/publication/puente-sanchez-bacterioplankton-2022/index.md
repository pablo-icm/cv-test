abstract: Abstract  Microbial assemblages under sea ice of Dease Strait, Canadian
  Arctic, were sequenced for metagenomes and metatranscriptomes of the small size
  fraction (0.2 to 3 µm). The community from early March was typical for this season,
  with Alpha - and Gammaproteobacteria as the dominant taxa, followed by Thaumarchaeota
  and Bacteroidetes . Towards summer, Bacteroidetes and particularly the genus Polaribacter
  , became increasingly dominant, followed by the Gammaproteobacteria . Analysis of
  genes responsible for microbial acquisition of iron showed an abundance of ABC transporters
  for divalent cations and ferrous iron. The most abundant transporters, however,
  were the outer membrane TonB dependent transporters of iron-siderophore complexes.
  The abundance of iron acquisition genes suggested this element was essential for
  the microbial assemblage. Interestingly, Gammaproteobacteria were responsible for
  most of the siderophore synthesis genes. On the contrary, Bacteroidetes did not
  synthesize siderophores but accounted for most of the transporters, suggesting a
  role as cheaters in the competition for siderophores as public goods. Likely, this
  cheating ability of the Bacteroidetes contributed to their dominance in summer.
