abstract: Microbial reduction of inorganic divalent mercury (Hg2+) and methylmercury
  (MeHg) demethylation is performed by the mer operon, specifically by merA and merB
  genes respectively, but little is known about the mercury tolerance capacity of
  marine microorganisms and its prevalence in the global ocean. Here, we explored
  the distribution of these genes in 290 marine heterotrophic bacteria (Alteromonas
  and Marinobacter spp.) isolated from different oceanographic regions and depths,
  and assessed their tolerance to diverse concentrations of Hg2+ and MeHg. About 25%
  of the isolates presented merA and only 8.9% presented both merAB genes, including
  the strain ISS312 that exhibited the highest tolerance capacity and a degradation
  efficiency of 98.2% in 24 h. Fragment recruitment analyses of ISS312 genome against
  microbial metagenomes indicated an extensive distribution across the global bathypelagic
  ocean. Our findings highlighted that mercury resistance genes are widely distributed
  in a non-highly polluted environment such as the pelagic marine environment, and
  that degradation of the neurotoxic MeHg can be performed through the ocean water
  column by some heterotrophic bacteria at high efficiency with important implications
  in the biogeochemical cycle of mercury and potentially for the environment and human
  health. Teaser Active mercury resistance genes detected in marine cultured bacteria
  are widely distributed in the ocean including the bathypelagic zone.
