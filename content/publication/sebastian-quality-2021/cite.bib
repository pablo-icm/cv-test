 abstract = {The bathypelagic ocean (1000-4000 m depth) is the largest aquatic biome on Earth but it is still largely unexplored. Due to its prevalent low dissolved organic carbon concentrations, most of the prokaryotic metabolic activity is assumed to be associated to particles. The role of free-living prokaryotes has thus been mostly ignored, except that of some chemolithoautotrophic lineages. Here we used a global bathypelagic survey of size-fractionated metagenomic and 16S (genes and transcripts) data and performed a differential abundance analysis to explore the functional traits of the different prokaryotic life-strategies, their contribution to the active microbiome, and the role that the quality of the dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays in driving this contribution. We found that free-living prokaryotes have limited capacity to uplift their metabolism in response to environmental changes and display comparatively lower growth rates than particle associated prokaryotes, but are responsible for the synthesis of vitamins in the bathypelagic. Furthermore, their contribution to the active prokaryotic microbiome increased towards waters depleted of labile DOM, which represented a large fraction of the tropical and subtropical ocean sampled stations. This points to a relevant yet overlooked role of free-living prokaryotes in DOM cycling in the vast bathypelagic desert.},
