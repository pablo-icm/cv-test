abstract: The bathypelagic ocean (1000-4000 m depth) is the largest aquatic biome
  on Earth but it is still largely unexplored. Due to its prevalent low dissolved
  organic carbon concentrations, most of the prokaryotic metabolic activity is assumed
  to be associated to particles. The role of free-living prokaryotes has thus been
  mostly ignored, except that of some chemolithoautotrophic lineages. Here we used
  a global bathypelagic survey of size-fractionated metagenomic and 16S (genes and
  transcripts) data and performed a differential abundance analysis to explore the
  functional traits of the different prokaryotic life-strategies, their contribution
  to the active microbiome, and the role that the quality of the dissolved organic
  matter (DOM) plays in driving this contribution. We found that free-living prokaryotes
  have limited capacity to uplift their metabolism in response to environmental changes
  and display comparatively lower growth rates than particle associated prokaryotes,
  but are responsible for the synthesis of vitamins in the bathypelagic. Furthermore,
  their contribution to the active prokaryotic microbiome increased towards waters
  depleted of labile DOM, which represented a large fraction of the tropical and subtropical
  ocean sampled stations. This points to a relevant yet overlooked role of free-living
  prokaryotes in DOM cycling in the vast bathypelagic desert.
