Mercury methylation genes (
hgcAB)
mediate the formation of the toxic methylmercury and have been identified from diverse environments, including freshwater and marine ecosystems, Arctic permafrost, forest and paddy soils, coal-ash amended sediments, chlor-alkali plants discharges and geothermal springs. Here we present the first attempt at a standardized protocol for the detection, identification and quantification of
hgc
genes from metagenomes. Our Hg-MATE (Hg-cycling Microorganisms in Aquatic and Terrestrial Ecosystems) database, a catalogue of
hgc
genes, provides the most accurate information to date on the taxonomic identity and functional/metabolic attributes of microorganisms responsible for Hg methylation in the environment. Furthermore, we introduce “marky-coco”, a ready-to-use bioinformatic pipeline based on
de novo
single-metagenome assembly, for easy and accurate characterization of
hgc
genes from environmental samples. We compared the recovery of
hgc
genes from environmental metagenomes using the marky-coco pipeline with an approach based on co-assembly of multiple metagenomes. Our data show similar efficiency in both approaches for most environments except those with high diversity (i.e., paddy soils) for which a co-assembly approach was preferred. Finally, we discuss the definition of true
hgc
genes and methods to normalize
hgc
gene counts from metagenomes.},
