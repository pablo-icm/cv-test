abstract: Cyanobacteria are important contributors to primary production in the open
  oceans. Over the past decade, various photosynthesis-related genes have been found
  in viruses that infect cyanobacteria (cyanophages). Although photosystem II (PSII)
  genes are common in both cultured cyanophages and environmental samples 1–4 , viral
  photosystem I (vPSI) genes have so far only been detected in environmental samples
  5,6 . Here, we have used a targeted strategy to isolate a cyanophage from the tropical
  Pacific Ocean that carries a PSI gene cassette with seven distinct PSI genes (psaJF,
  C, A, B, K, E, D) as well as two PSII genes (psbA, D). This cyanophage, P-TIM68,
  belongs to the T4-like myoviruses, has a prolate capsid, a long contractile tail
  and infects Prochlorococcus sp. strain MIT9515. Phage photosynthesis genes from
  both photosystems are expressed during infection, and the resultant proteins are
  incorporated into membranes of the infected host. Moreover, photosynthetic capacity
  in the cell is maintained throughout the infection cycle with enhancement of cyclic
  electron flow around PSI. Analysis of metagenomic data from the Tara Oceans expedition
  7 shows that phages carrying PSI gene cassettes are abundant in the tropical Pacific
  Ocean, composing up to 28% of T4-like cyanomyophages. They are also present in the
  tropical Indian and Atlantic Oceans. P-TIM68 populations, specifically, compose
  on average 22% of the PSI-gene-cassette carrying phages. Our results suggest that
  cyanophages carrying PSI and PSII genes are likely to maintain and even manipulate
  photosynthesis during infection of their Prochlorococcus hosts in the tropical oceans.
