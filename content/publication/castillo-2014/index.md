abstract: The presence of the green and Kemp's ridley turtles is rare at Atlantic
  and Mediterranean Spanish waters, but the records have increased during the last
  decades. We reported a new set of records and reviewed all the historical observations
  of these species. The analysis of a mitochondrial DNA fragment of the newest records
  provided insights about the origin of the individuals. The Kemp's ridley turtles
  arrived from the western Atlantic nesting beaches, although the discovering of a
  new haplotype suggested the existence of an unknown or low sampled nesting area
  of origin. Furthermore, the genetic analysis was crucial for the species identification
  in one specimen, hence recommending the use of genetic markers to confirm the presence
  of a rare species. All green turtles presented haplotypes exclusive from Atlantic
  nesting beaches and concentrated in the African populations. Thus, the closest eastern
  Mediterranean nesting areas were discarded as source populations and a new migration
  route for this species was described.
