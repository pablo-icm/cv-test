abstract: Understanding how historical and contemporary processes shape and maintain
  genetic diversity patterns is a central challenge for ecologists with direct implications
  in biodiversity conservation. Here, we studied the population genetic structure
  of Paramuricea clavata a habitat forming octocoral from the coralligenous, the most
  diverse but also most threatened biogenic reef in the Mediterranean. Focusing on
  13 populations along a latitudinal gradient in the eastern Adriatic and using microsatellite
  markers, we revealed a pattern of spatial genetic structure combining hierarchical
  genetic clusters and isolation by distance (IBD). Interestingly, this pattern came
  along with a significant northward decrease in genetic diversity. While oceanographic
  barriers to gene flow and restricted dispersal abilities may maintain the IBD and
  the genetic clusters, the latitudinal genetic gradient raises the question of the
  legacy of historical processes on the contemporary genetic structure. Implementing
  extensive evolutionary and demographic history analyses based on approximate Bayesian
  computations and maximum likelihood methods, we demonstrated that a northward “serial
  founder events range expansion” following the last glacial maximum may explain this
  latitudinal genetic gradient. Besides, some alleles reach high frequencies at the
  edge of expansion suggesting the occurrence of allele surfing during this expansion
  range. Integrating these patterns and processes, we bridge the gap between the evolutionary
  and the conservation biology of P. clavata in the eastern Adriatic and we promote
  an eco-evolutionary based management plan, which will benefit the associated coralligenous
  biodiversity
