  are phylogenetically and metabolically diverse. Yet capturing this diversity, assigning
  functions to host organisms and exploring the biosynthetic potential in natural
  environments remains challenging. We reconstructed &gt;25,000 draft genomes, including
  from &gt;2,500 uncharacterized species, from globally-distributed ocean microbial
  communities, and combined them with ∼10,000 genomes from cultivated and single cells.
  Mining this resource revealed ∼40,000 putative biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs),
  many from unknown phylogenetic groups. Among these, we discovered textitCandidatus
  Eudoremicrobiaceae as one of the most biosynthetically diverse microbes detected
  to date. Discrete transcriptional states structuring natural populations were associated
  with a potentially niche-partitioning role for BGC products. Together with the characterization
  of the first Eudoremicrobiaceae natural product, this study demonstrates how microbiomics
  enables prospecting for candidate bioactive compounds in underexplored microbes
  and environments.textless/ptextgreater
