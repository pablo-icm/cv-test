abstract: textlessptextgreaterThe Ocean microbiome has a crucial role on Earth9s biogeochemical
  cycles, but also represents a tremendous potential for biological applications as
  part of the blue-biotechnology. During the last decade, global cruises such as Tara
  Oceans or the Malaspina Expedition have expanded our knowledge on the diversity
  and genetic repertoire of marine microbes. Nevertheless, there is still a gap of
  knowledge on broad scale patterns between photic and bathypelagic dark ocean microbes
  derived by the lack of detailed vertical profiles covering contrasting oceans regions.
  Here we present 76 microbial metagenomes of the picoplankton size fraction (0.2-3.0
  microns) from 11 stations along the Malaspina Expedition circumnavigation that cover
  vertical profiles sampling at 7 depths, from surface to the 4000m deep (or the sea
  floor in shallower waters). The Malaspina Microbial Vertical Profiles metagenomes
  (MProfile) dataset produced 1.66 Tbp of raw DNA sequences and assembled them into
  a total 25.3 Gbp. After gene prediction and annotation, we built a 46.3 million
  non-redundant gene compendium with their corresponding annotations (M-GeneDB-VP),
  clustered at 95% sequence similarity. This dataset will be a valuable resource for
  exploring the functional and taxonomic connectivity between the photic and bathypelagic
  ocean at a global scale, while increasing our general knowledge on the Ocean microbiome.textless/ptextgreater
