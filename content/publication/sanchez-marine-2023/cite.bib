 abstract = {\textlessp\textgreaterThe Ocean microbiome has a crucial role on Earth9s biogeochemical cycles, but also represents a tremendous potential for biological applications as part of the blue-biotechnology. During the last decade, global cruises such as Tara Oceans or the Malaspina Expedition have expanded our knowledge on the diversity and genetic repertoire of marine microbes. Nevertheless, there is still a gap of knowledge on broad scale patterns between photic and bathypelagic dark ocean microbes derived by the lack of detailed vertical profiles covering contrasting oceans regions. Here we present 76 microbial metagenomes of the picoplankton size fraction (0.2-3.0 microns) from 11 stations along the Malaspina Expedition circumnavigation that cover vertical profiles sampling at 7 depths, from surface to the 4000m deep (or the sea floor in shallower waters). The Malaspina Microbial Vertical Profiles metagenomes (MProfile) dataset produced 1.66 Tbp of raw DNA sequences and assembled them into a total 25.3 Gbp. After gene prediction and annotation, we built a 46.3 million non-redundant gene compendium with their corresponding annotations (M-GeneDB-VP), clustered at 95% sequence similarity. This dataset will be a valuable resource for exploring the functional and taxonomic connectivity between the photic and bathypelagic ocean at a global scale, while increasing our general knowledge on the Ocean microbiome.\textless/p\textgreater},
