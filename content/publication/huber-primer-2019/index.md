abstract: High-throughput sequencing (HTS) of the 16S rRNA gene has been used successfully
  to describe the structure and dynamics of microbial communities. Picocyanobacteria
  are important members of bacterioplankton communities, and, so far, they have predominantly
  been targeted using universal bacterial primers, providing a limited resolution
  of the picocyanobacterial community structure and dynamics. To increase such resolution,
  the study of a particular target group is best approached with the use of specific
  primers. Here, we aimed to design and evaluate specific primers for aquatic picocyanobacterial
  genera to be used with high-throughput sequencing. Since the various regions of
  the 16S rRNA gene have different degrees of conservation in different bacterial
  groups, we therefore first determined which hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA
  gene provides the highest taxonomic and phylogenetic resolution for the genera Synechococcus,
  Prochlorococcus, and Cyanobium. An in silico analysis showed that the V5, V6, and
  V7 hypervariable regions appear to be the most informative for this group. We then
  designed primers flanking these hypervariable regions and tested them in natural
  marine and freshwater communities. We successfully detected that most (97%) of the
  obtained reads could be assigned to picocyanobacterial genera. We defined operational
  taxonomic units as exact sequence variants (zero-radius operational taxonomic units
  [zOTUs]), which allowed us to detect higher genetic diversity and infer ecologically
  relevant information about picocyanobacterial community composition and dynamics
  in different aquatic systems. Our results open the door to future studies investigating
  picocyanobacterial diversity in aquatic systems.
