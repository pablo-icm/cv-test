abstract: ©2017 Royo-Llonch, Ferrera, Cornejo-Castillo, Sánchez, Salazar, Stepanauskas,
  González, Sieracki, Speich, Stemmann, Pedrós-Alió and Acinas. Marine Bacteroidetes
  constitute a very abundant bacterioplankton group in the oceans that plays a key
  role in recycling particulate organic matter and includes several photoheterotrophic
  members containing proteorhodopsin. Relatively few marine Bacteroidetes species
  have been described and, moreover, they correspond to cultured isolates, which in
  most cases do not represent the actual abundant or ecologically relevant microorganisms
  in the natural environment. In this study, we explored the microdiversity of 98
  Single Amplified Genomes (SAGs) retrieved from the surface waters of the underexplored
  North Indian Ocean, whose most closely related isolate is Kordia algicida OT-1.
  Using Multi Locus Sequencing Analysis (MLSA) we found no microdiversity in the tested
  conserved phylogenetic markers (16S rRNA and 23S rRNA genes), the fast-evolving
  Internal Transcribed Spacer and the functional markers proteorhodopsin and the beta-subunit
  of RNA polymerase. Furthermore, we carried out a Fragment Recruitment Analysis (FRA)
  with marine metagenomes to learn about the distribution and dynamics of this microorganism
  in different locations, depths and size fractions. This analysis indicated that
  this taxon belongs to the rare biosphere, showing its highest abundance after upwelling-induced
  phytoplankton blooms and sinking to the deep ocean with large organic matter particles.
  This uncultured Kordia lineage likely represents a novel Kordia species (Kordia
  sp. CFSAG39SUR) that contains the proteorhodopsin gene and has a widespread spatial
  and vertical distribution. The combination of SAGs and MLSA makes a valuable approach
  to infer putative ecological roles of uncultured abundant microorganisms.
