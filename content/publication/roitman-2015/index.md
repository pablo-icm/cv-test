abstract: Marine photosynthesis is largely driven by cyanobacteria, namely Synechococcus
  and Prochlorococcus. Genes encoding for photosystem (PS) I and II reaction centre
  proteins are found in cyanophages and are believed to increase their fitness. Two
  viral PSI gene arrangements are known, psaJF→C→A→B→K→E→D and psaD→C→A→B. The shared
  genes between these gene cassettes and their encoded proteins are distinguished
  by %G + C and protein sequence respectively. The data on the psaD→C→A→B gene organization
  were reported from only two partial gene cassettes coming from Global Ocean Sampling
  stations in the Pacific and Indian oceans. Now we have extended our search to 370
  marine stations from six metagenomic projects. Genes corresponding to both PSI gene
  arrangements were detected in the Pacific, Indian and Atlantic oceans, confined
  to a strip along the equator (30°N and 30°S). In addition, we found that the predicted
  structure of the viral PsaA protein from the psaD→C→A→B organization contains a
  lumenal loop conserved in PsaA proteins from Synechococcus, but is completely absent
  in viral PsaA proteins from the psaJF→C→A→B→K→E→D gene organization and most Prochlorococcus
  strains. This may indicate a co-evolutionary scenario where cyanophages containing
  either of these gene organizations infect cyanobacterial ecotypes biogeographically
  restricted to the 30°N and 30°S equatorial strip.
