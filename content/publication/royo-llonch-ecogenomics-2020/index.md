abstract: textlessh3textgreaterSummarytextless/h3textgreater textlessptextgreaterThe
  Arctic Ocean is a key player in the regulation of climate and at the same time is
  under increasing pressure as a result of climate change. Predicting the future of
  this ecosystem requires understanding of the responses of Arctic microorganisms
  to environmental change, as they are the main drivers of global biogeochemical cycles.
  However, little is known about the ecology and metabolic potential of active Arctic
  microbes. Here, we reconstructed a total of 3,550 metagenomic bins from 41 seawater
  metagenomes collected as part of the Tara Oceans expedition, covering five different
  Arctic Ocean regions as well as the sub-Arctic North Atlantic Ocean and including
  various depths and different seasons (spring to autumn). Of these bins, 530 could
  be classified as Metagenome Assembled Genomes (MAGs) and over 75% of them represented
  novel species. We describe their habitat range and environmental preferences, as
  well as their metabolic capabilities, building the most comprehensive dataset of
  uncultured bacterial and archaeal genomes from the Arctic Ocean to date. We found
  a prevalence of mixotrophs, while chemolithoautotrophs were mostly present in the
  mesopelagic Arctic Ocean during spring and autumn. Finally, the catalogue of Arctic
  MAGs was complemented with metagenomes and metatranscriptomes from the global ocean
  to identify the most active MAGs present exclusively in polar metagenomes. These
  polar MAGs, which display a range of metabolic strategies, might represent Arctic
  sentinels of climate change and should be considered in prospective studies of the
  future state of the Arctic Ocean.textless/ptextgreater
