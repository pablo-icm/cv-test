abstract: Cultivable bacteria represent only a fraction of the diversity in microbial
  communities. However, the official procedures for classification and characterization
  of a novel prokaryotic species still rely on isolates. Nevertheless, due to single
  cell genomics, it is possible to retrieve genomes from environmental samples by
  sequencing them individually, and to assign specific genes to a specific taxon,
  regardless of their ability to grow in culture. In this study, a complete description
  was performed for uncultured Kordia sp. TARA_039_SRF, a proposed novel species within
  the genus Kordia, using culture-independent techniques. The type material was a
  high-quality draft genome (94.97% complete, 4.65% gene redundancy) co-assembled
  using ten nearly identical single amplified genomes (SAGs) from surface seawater
  in the North Indian Ocean during the Tara Oceans Expedition. The assembly process
  was optimized to obtain the best possible assembly metrics and a less fragmented
  genome. The closest relative of the species was Kordia periserrulae, which shared
  97.56% similarity of the 16S rRNA gene, 75% orthologs and 89.13% average nucleotide
  identity. The functional potential of the proposed novel species included proteorhodopsin,
  the ability to incorporate nitrate, cytochrome oxidases with high affinity for oxygen,
  and CAZymes that were unique features within the genus. Its abundance at different
  depths and size fractions was also evaluated together with its functional annotation,
  revealing that its putative ecological niche could be particles of phytoplanktonic
  origin. It could putatively attach to these particles and consume them while sinking
  to the deeper and oxygen depleted layers of the North Indian Ocean.
