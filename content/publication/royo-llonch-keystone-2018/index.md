abstract: Microbial community composition in the north polar waters varies greatly
  throughout the year. Spring melting of the ice and increase in light disposal spur
  the bloom of phytoplankton, taking over the functional and phylogenetically diverse
  bacterioplankton communities of dark and cold winter waters. Mainly heterotrophic
  and photoheterotrophic bacterial populations feed on the nutrients derived from
  the phytoplankton bloom during summer. With fall 패s shorter light hours and colder
  seawater temperatures, the bacterial community shifts to those chemolithoautotrophic
  that will prevail during winter. TaraOceans navigated around the north polar waters
  extensively sampling the microbial plankton communities during spring, summer and
  the beginning of fall (May to October 2013). We have generated around 900 microbial
  metagenomic assembled genomes (or MAGs) from the combination of the 41 sequenced
  metagenomes, which cover the whole polar circle from spring to the beginning of
  fall. Together with the physical and chemical information of all stations we are
  capable of detecting the distribution of the different keystone prokaryotic taxa
  around the pole and through the seasons at maximum resolution possible, at genome
  level, with a particular focus on the genomics and metabolic potential of those
  following the phenology of phytoplankton blooms
