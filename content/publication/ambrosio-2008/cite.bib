 abstract = {Morphological changes in Senegalese sole adults (Solea senegalensis Kaup, 1858) reared at two stocking density conditions (low stocking density, 60% of bottom occupation and high stocking density, 180% of bottom occupation) were investigated using geometric morphometrics. Canonical variate analysis on weight matrix scores, including the uniform component (W′), at the end of the experiment revealed differences in body shape between experimental groups. The low density group presented a similar change pattern as that of the high density group but was less intense. Differences were discussed in terms of the effect of a high stocking density on the shape of soles which were very close to commercialization. Results did not indicate a significant size-related shape, likely due to fish age. Our results provide the first promising look at environment-related shape changes in reared sole.},
