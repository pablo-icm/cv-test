abstract: Microbes are important drivers of biogeochemical processes determining the
  fate of mercury (Hg) in the aquatic systems. In particular, they have a relevant
  role on formation and degradation of methylmercury (MeHg) but also on the reduction
  of inorganic divalent Hg (HgII) to elemental Hg0. The recent discovery of the gene
  cluster involved in MeHg formation (hgcA/hgcB) has improved the knowledge on identity
  and metabolic features of the microbial community performing this process. Yet,
  little is known about the diversity and expression of the organisms involved in
  MeHg demethylation and HgII reduction, which are carried out by the merB and merA
  genes, respectively. Here, we explore the temperate global deep ocean metagenomes
  and metatranscriptomes of the Malapasina 2010 circumnavigation from two different
  plankton size fractions (0.2-0.8 μm and 0.8-20 μm), commonly referred to the life-style
  of free-living and particle–attached microorganisms, respectively. By using multiple-specific
  hidden markov models (HMM), here we show the biogeography and expression patterns
  of merA and merB genes. Analysing the metagenomes, we observed that the abundance
  patterns of merA and merB responded to the life-style of the organisms, with higher
  abundance in the particle-attached size fraction, as well as to the oceanographic
  basin. Interestingly, the metatranscriptomes revealed that expression patterns of
  merA and merB genes differed with their corresponding abundances. For example, merA
  and merB expression patterns in the Canary Islands basin were significantly lower
  in particle-attached compared to the free-living fraction. Alteromonas and Pseudoalteromonas
  (Gammaproteobacteria) were important contributors to both the abundance and expression
  of merA and merB at a global scale. This study represents the first global deep
  ocean analysis of the merAB genes and transcripts and reveals the main players involved
  in the divalent-Hg reduction and MeHg degradation in the marine Hg biogeochemical
  cycle
