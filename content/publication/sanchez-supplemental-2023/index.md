abstract: 'Supplemental data for 76 microbial metagenomes of the picoplankton size
  fraction (0.2-3.0 μm) collected in 11 stations along the Malaspina Expedition circumnavigation
  (http://www.expedicionmalaspina.es) that cover vertical profiles sampled at 7 depths,
  from the surface to 4,000 m deep (or the sea floor in shallower waters), published

  profiles obtained by the Malaspina Expedition in the tropical and subtropical oceans.
