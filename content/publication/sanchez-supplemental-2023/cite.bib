 abstract = {Supplemental data for 76 microbial metagenomes of the picoplankton size fraction (0.2-3.0 μm) collected in 11 stations along the Malaspina Expedition circumnavigation (http://www.expedicionmalaspina.es) that cover vertical profiles sampled at 7 depths, from the surface to 4,000 m deep (or the sea floor in shallower waters), published in Sánchez, P. et al., 2023. Marine picoplankton metagenomes from eleven vertical profiles obtained by the Malaspina Expedition in the tropical and subtropical oceans. bioRxiv 2023.02.06.526790; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.02.06.526790.

This repository includes a 20.6 million non-redundant gene compendium with their corresponding annotations (M-GeneDB-VP), clustered at 95% sequence similarity, the functional profile tables for COG and KO and taxonomic profiles based on mTAGs analysis at the OTU level.},
