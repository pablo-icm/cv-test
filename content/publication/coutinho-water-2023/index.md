abstract: Viruses play important roles in the ocean’s biogeochemical cycles. Yet,
  deep ocean viruses are one of the most under-explored fractions of the global biosphere.
  Little is known about the environmental factors that control the composition and
  functioning of their communities or how they interact with their free-living or
  particle-attached microbial hosts.
