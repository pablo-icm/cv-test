 abstract = {Aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic (AAP) bacteria play a relevant role in the marine microbial food web, but little is known about their long-term seasonal dynamics. Using Illumina amplicon sequencing of the puf M gene coupled with multivariate, time series and co-occurrence analyses we examined their temporal dynamics over a decade at the Blanes Bay Microbial Observatory (NW Mediterranean). Phylogroup K ( Gammaproteobacteria ) was the most abundant over all seasons, with phylogroups E and G ( Alphaproteobacteria ) being often abundant in spring. A clear seasonal trend was observed in diversity, with maximum values in winter. Multivariate analyses showed sample clustering by season, with a relevant proportion of the variance (38%) explained by day length, temperature, salinity, phototrophic nanoflagellate abundance and phosphate concentration. Time series analysis showed that only 42% of the Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) analyzed presented marked seasonality but these represented most of the abundance (92%). Interestingly, distinct temporal dynamics were observed within the same phylogroup and even within different ASVs conforming the same Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU). Likewise, co-occurrence analysis highlighted negative associations between various ASVs within the same phylogroup. Altogether our results picture the AAP assemblage as highly seasonal, containing ecotypes with distinctive niche partitioning rather than being a cohesive functional group.},
