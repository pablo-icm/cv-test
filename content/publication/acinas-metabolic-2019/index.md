abstract: The deep sea, the largest compartment of the ocean, is an essential component
  of the Earth system, but the functional exploration of its microbial communities
  lags far behind that of other marine realms. Here we analyze 58 bathypelagic microbial
  metagenomes from the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans in an unprecedented sampling
  effort from the Malaspina Global Expedition, to resolve the metabolic architecture
  of the deep ocean microbiome. The Malaspina Deep-Sea Gene Collection, 71% of which
  consists of novel genes, reveals a strong dichotomy between the functional traits
  of free-living and particle-attached microorganisms, and shows relatively patchy
  composition challenging the paradigm of a uniform dark ocean ecosystem. Metagenome
  Assembled Genomes uncovered 11 potential new phyla, establishing references for
  deep ocean microbial taxa, and revealed mixotrophy to be a widespread trophic strategy
  in the deep ocean. These results expand our understanding of the functional diversity,
  metabolic versatility, and carbon cycling in the largest ecosystem on Earth.One
  Sentence Summary A whole community genomic survey of the deep microbiome sheds light
  on the microbial and functional diversity of the dark ocean.
