abstract: The role of the Arctic Ocean ecosystem in climate regulation may depend
  on the responses of marine microorganisms to environmental change. We applied genome-resolved
  metagenomics to 41 Arctic seawater samples, collected at various depths in different
  seasons during the Tara Oceans Polar Circle expedition, to evaluate the ecology,
  metabolic potential and activity of resident bacteria and archaea. We assembled
  530 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) to form the Arctic MAGs catalogue comprising
  526 species. A total of 441 MAGs belonged to species that have not previously been
  reported and 299 genomes showed an exclusively polar distribution. Most Arctic MAGs
  have large genomes and the potential for fast generation times, both of which may
  enable adaptation to a copiotrophic lifestyle in nutrient-rich waters. We identified
  38 habitat generalists and 111 specialists in the Arctic Ocean. We also found a
  general prevalence of 14 mixotrophs, while chemolithoautotrophs were mostly present
  in the mesopelagic layer during spring and autumn. We revealed 62 MAGs classified
  as key Arctic species, found only in the Arctic Ocean, showing the highest gene
  expression values and predicted to have habitat-specific traits. The Artic MAGs
  catalogue will inform our understanding of polar microorganisms that drive global
  biogeochemical cycles. Using genome-resolved metagenomics for 41 Arctic seawater
  samples, this ecogenomic analysis of 530 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from
  the polar Arctic Ocean reveals uncultured Arctic bacterial and archaeal MAGs, their
  gene expression patterns, habitat preferences and metabolic potential.
