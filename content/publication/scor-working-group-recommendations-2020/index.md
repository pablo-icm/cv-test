abstract: Tracking how ocean life is responding to increased human use and climate
  change will empower the global community to predict, mitigate, and manage our ocean.
  In this document we demonstrate the existence of mature technologies to measure
  ‘biology’ as a combination of biomass and diversity indicators across the plankton
  size spectrum. These are now ready to deploy within the GO-SHIP constraints
